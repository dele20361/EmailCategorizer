# Email Categorizer

## Project Overview

**Topic Selected and Justification: Email Tagger**

The objective of this project is to build a system that automatically labels emails using machine learning techniques to classify emails into predefined categories.

Email tagging is an essential task in many environments, both personal and corporate. Efficient email management is critical to maintaining high productivity. According to a study conducted by Radicati Group last year (2023), the number of emails sent and received daily in 2024 was projected to exceed **347 billion**. This staggering number highlights the pressing need for effective tools to manage this overwhelming flow of emails.

Many individuals and companies face the challenge of handling a high volume of emails, which can result in a significant waste of time if done manually. This project aims to tackle the issue of **"context switching,"** which occurs when users are constantly interrupted by email notifications. This not only drastically reduces productivity but also increases the likelihood of making mistakes in ongoing tasks (PPM Express, 2023). According to the same study, employees spend approximately **23% of their work time** managing emails, showcasing the enormous impact that an automated tool like this classifier could have on workplace efficiency.

## Dataset Reference

The dataset used for this project is the **[Topic Modelling on Emails Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dipankarsrirag/topic-modelling-on-emails/data)** available on Kaggle. 

### Dataset Overview:
This dataset contains emails organized into four categories:
1. **Crime**
2. **Entertainment**
3. **Politics**
4. **Science**

Each email in the dataset is a text file stored in subdirectories representing its respective category. The dataset is suitable for text classification tasks and is designed for applications like topic modeling and machine learning-based classification.

### Why This Dataset?
This dataset is ideal for the project because:
- It provides pre-labeled emails, making it straightforward to apply supervised learning techniques.
- The variety of topics allows for the exploration of classification models in a realistic, multi-category scenario.
- The dataset format is lightweight and easy to preprocess.

### Accessing the Dataset:
